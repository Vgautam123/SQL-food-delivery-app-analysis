# SQL-food-delivery-app-analysis
**Introduction:**

This project contains SQL queries and analysis for a food delivery app's database. The aim is to extract valuable insights such as customer behavior, order trends to help optimize business operations.

**The SQL analysis is divided into several key modules:**

_Customer Behavior Analysis_: Who are the most frequent users? How can we increase customer retention and encourage more membership sign-ups?

_Order and Product Trends_: What are the best-selling products? How does pricing influence purchasing behavior?

_Gold Membership Insights_: Analyze the impact of the app's gold membership on customer behavior and revenue.

**Key Features:**

_Gold Membership Table_ : Includes a column is_gold_member to identify whether the user is part of the app's premium Gold Membership program. Gold members typically receive special discounts, priority delivery, and exclusive offers.

_Products Table_: Contains pricing information for the various food items offered through the app, allowing for analysis of pricing strategies and customer spending.
